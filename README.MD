# GenEvolve3D: Genetic Evolution Simulation


# *OUTDATED README* ... YAML CI/CD THROWN OFF BY DRASTIC DEPENDENCY CHANGE...
# WILL UPDATE IN FUTURE WITH EXECUTABLE ARTIFACTS
## Overview
GenEvolve3D combines neural networks and genetic algorithms to simulate genetic evolution in an artificial environment, enhanced with 3D visualizations.

## Quick Start
- **Installation:** `git clone [repository link]` then `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Run Simulation:** Execute `python3 main.py`
- **Documentation & Examples:** See `Demo_Tests` directory.

## Features
- Evolutionary modeling with generational tracking.
- Decision-making via MLPRegressor from scikit-learn.
- Interactive 3D graphics for process visualization.

## Contributing
Guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Contributions are welcome!

## Future Updates
- Including an executable installer for easier setup.
